linear_search :
    Performs linear search to find the index of `x` in `arr`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    arr : list of int
    x : int

    Returns
    -------
    int
        the index `i` such that `x == arr[i]` if such `i` exists,
        otherwise -1

binary_search:

    Performs binary search on already sorted list to find the index for `x` in `arr`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    arr : list of int
        already sorted in ascending order
    x : int

    Returns
    -------
    int
        the smallest index `i` such that `x < arr[i]` while assuming that
        the imaginary leftmost element of `arr` is negative infinity and
        the imaginary rightmost element of `arr` is positive infinity
        (if `x` is greater than or equal to every element in `arr`, then return the length of `arr`)

distinct:
    Tests whether all elements in given list are distinct or not.
    (Please implement it using hashing as in lecture slides.)

    Parameters
    ----------
    arr : list of int
        nonempty list whose length is at most 20,000 and whose elements are positive
    Returns
    -------
    bool
        `True` if all elements are distinct,
        `False` otherwise
